# <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-19">K19</a> &mdash; Allegorical Abbreviation for COVID-19.

This is just a play space for exploring the K19 data, while in self-isolation.*

The following is an indicator of the world's recovery rates. The Recovery and Death Rates are defined as Recovered/Confirmed and Deaths/Confirmed, respectively. As they are ratios, they seem more robust to variances in the reliability of reporting. Also, they are somewhat scale invariant, as in, we don't know the true cases but the ratio should remain fairly constant, regardless.

As I'm a Winnipeger, I'm interested in Canadian Stats. Here's are the <a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/index.html">Confirmend Cases for Manitoba</a>.

I've also been looking at some of the major provinces, as a Canadian.

And how Canada is doing as a whole.
